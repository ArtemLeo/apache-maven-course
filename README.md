<h1 align>Apache Maven Course 🖐</h1>
<h3>🟠 The Apache Maven course contains information about the automated project build tool that is fully responsible for the Java application lifecycle.</h3>
<h3>🟠 That's why let's analyze the main plugins that are most often used in real projects:</h3>
<h4>- Surefire for running unit tests</h4>
<h4>- Failsafe for running integration tests</h4>
<h4>- Jacoco for generating documentation about passed tests and their source code coverage</h4>
<h4>- Release for creating release versions of projects and pushing them to a remote repository (github)</h4>
<h4>- Assembly to package your application into archives (jar)</h4>
<h4>- Dependency for downloading all dependencies (and transitive dependencies too) into separate directories (this is how many other Java applications do it, such as Apache Tomcat, Apache Maven, Gradle, etc.).</h4>
