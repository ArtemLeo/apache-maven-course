<h1 align>Apache Maven Course 🖐</h1>
<h3>🟠 The Apache Maven course contains information about the automated project build tool that is fully responsible for the Java application lifecycle. We will go into the source code of Apache Maven to understand the basic core of it, which is actually plugins and Mojo (Maven plain Old Java Object).</h3>
<h3>🟠 That's why let's analyze the main plugins that are most often used in real projects:
- Surefire for running unit tests
- Failsafe for running integration tests
- Jacoco for generating documentation about passed tests and their source code coverage
- Release for creating release versions of projects and pushing them to a remote repository (github)
- Assembly to package your application into archives (jar)
- Dependency for downloading all dependencies (and transitive dependencies too) into separate directories (this is how many other Java applications do it, such as Apache Tomcat, Apache Maven, Gradle, etc.).</h3>
